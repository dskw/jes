JES
===
**JES** stands for **J**ava **E**vent **S**ystem.

It is a very basic implementation of a threadded system to execute events at a given time. The goal of this project is to develop JES into a small library that can be incorporated into games and applications that require a mulitude of updates at given timestamps.

The example application uses a very simple event that calculates a fraction of PI to consume some CPU time, with a slight chance of unexpected extended calculations which take much longer.
